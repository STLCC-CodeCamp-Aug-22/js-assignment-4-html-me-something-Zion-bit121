                  Now these two fighters shall settle who is greater by facing off against each other to the death. 
                  With both warriors Link and Jack are prepared for battle and blades are drawn, the battle is ready to unfold. 
                  Link and Jack begin their battle, the first attack comes from Jack as he charges at Link with his sword raised high in the air. 
                  Jack's attack is blocked by Link's wooden katana, but Jack's attack was only feint for he quickly pulls out his magic sword and slashes down on Link's shield causing it to shatter into pieces. 
                  As Link falls back Jack throws his magic sword and hurls it right at Link's face. 
                  Link raises his shield just in time to deflect the magic sword and send it flying towards Jack's feet. 
                  Jack pulls out his bow and shoots another arrow at Link who dodges the arrow by jumping up and grabbing onto Jack's leg, 
                  Jack then spins around and kicks Link away sending him crashing into a wall. 
                  Jack then places his foot on Link's neck and begins to strangle him, but Link uses his magic shield to push the blade from Jack's hand and then grabs hold of the bow and shoots two arrows into Jack's stomach. 
                  Jack screams in agony as he falls to the ground and dies.
                  Jack's death brings about a new beginning for Link as he returns home to Hyrule castle. 
                  There he finds Princess Zelda waiting for him, but she isn't there for romance this princess is furious. 
                  She tells Link that the evil Ganondwarfs have invaded Hyrule and must be stopped at all costs. 
                  Link then goes to find his sister and bring her back from the tower where she has been trapped. 
                  When Link gets to the tower he sees the true evil of Ganon for the first time as he watches the light leave his sister's eyes and die within the walls of the tower. 
                  Now Link must embark on a journey across Hyrule to stop Ganon before he can destroy everything his sister has worked so hard to protect.

                     Apple Dog is a good boyo who is beloved by everyone who meet him no matter what. 
                     Apple Dog love everyone and is better then Banana Cat in every way because Apple Dog is the good boy wo never gives up. 
                     Many people agree that Apple Dog is the best but when approached Apple Dog simple says he isn't so cool and how Banana Cat is still his best bud in the whole world.
                     <br>
                     This made the people love him more.

                  <p id="BananaCat">
                     Banana Cat is a deceptively cute feline that attracts mainly the attention of those who are cat lovers more. 
                     while seemingly nice, we all know that they are hinding some thing super evil in their mists. 
                     but hey Apple Dog trusts them so maybe that aren't so bad after all.
